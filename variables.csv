For copper, we estimate that on the average there will be 3.5 units of nickel produced for every 100 units of copper. With this number, the nickel amount produced on a global scale from copper seems to fit well (100,000 ton Ni/yr) The average ore grade for PGM is a few gram per ton ore. The nickel on average extracted is about 500 times that. Thus, about 2,000 ton nickel/yr is co-produced with PGM from mines. PGM is also co-produced from nickel mines, but that is a separate story."

Different GHGs can have different effects on the Earth's warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their ""radiative efficiency""), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (also known as their ""lifetime""). The GWP was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. The time period usually used for GWPs is 100 years, but it may be argued that a shorter time- frame could be used to assess the shorter-term effects of some gases such as CH4 which has a much higher short-term warming effect than CO2 (e.g., Howarth, R.W., Santoro, R., Ingraffea, A., 2011.

Use of water in the mining industry shares many of the characteristics of other industrial uses but it has some distinctive features that make it worth considering in further detail. (Prosser et al, 2011) Industrial water is used in the copper industry for various purposes, including direct and indirect cooling, waste transport, flotation, slag granulation and electrolysis. Copper Alliance members use the best available wastewater treatment techniques (as defined by the European Commission), which ensure that dissolved metals and solids are effectively removed. In addition, the purified water is increasingly reused, which significantly reduces the consumption of fresh water and further protects the environment and reduces the use of natural resources. (Prosser et al, 2011) Increasing production has used up most of the higher-grade ores so that the industry is increasingly accessing ores of lower quality, which require greater volumes of water to be used per tonne of metal produced. (Prosser et al, 2011) The average amount of water used per pound of copper mined varies from mine to mine and from year to year, as mining and processing rates change and as market prices fluctuate (Singh, 2010). Singh reports on water use (gallons) per pound of copper from 6,7-62,3 based on production data from DMMR files (Department of Minerals and Mines Resources). Prosser, I., Wolf, L., & Littleboy, A. (2011). Water in mining and industry. Water: Science and Solutions for Australia, 135â€“146. Singh, M. M. (2010). Water Consumption at Copper Mines in Arizona.

There are strong prospects for further growth in iron ore extraction in coming decades and exponential growth of the burgeoning coal seam gas industry, which is also a major water user. Demand for water by the mining sector is therefore likely to increase, with projections ranging from 810 GL/year to 940 GL/year use by 2027 for Western Australia alone. Water is used by the minerals industry for the following operational activities: -Transport of ore and waste in slurries and suspensions -Separation of minerals through chemical processes -Physical separation of materials, such as in centrifugal separation -Cooling systems for power generation -Suppression of dust during mineral processing and around conveyors and roads -Washing equipment -Dewatering of mines.
