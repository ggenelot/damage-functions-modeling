Notebooks
=========

Welcome to the Notebooks section of the documentation. This section contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various concepts and examples. It starts with a first visualisation of the raw results. It continues with a reflexion on ethical concepts such as spatial or temporal equity, and how to incorporate these concepts inside the model itself. We then analyse the variability of the results by a linear regression of the total level of damage.
