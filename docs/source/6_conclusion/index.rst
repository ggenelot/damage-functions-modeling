API Documentation

.. note:: 

    Disclaimer : 
    
    This documentation is under work. It is uncomplete, and does not intend to replace each model's documentation. Modeling is a technical practice, involving many choices that should be understood before taking any conclusions out of a model's results. In this regard, this section is subject to caution : some functions could have been implemented or understood wrong.

    However, the point of this section is to provide a quick and unified overview of a range of damage functions from different models, in a way that is easily readable.
